# Ballsdex-leaderboard-pack
Leaderboard pack for ballsdex v2 (soon v3)

## How to install:
Manual:
First, download the repo. Pretty simple.
Then, create a new folder in ballsdex/packages called 'Leaderboard'. Also pretty easy.
After that, paste the cog.py and __init__.py into the leaderboard folder. Open config.yml in the main ballsdex folder, and add ballsdex.packages.leaderboard under the packages: thing on line 100 or so.
Restart the bot, and you should be good to go! Support for v3 wil come soon, hopefully.
Automatic:
No automatic yet lmao
